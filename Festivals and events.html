                    <h2>Eid-ul-Fitr & Eid-ul-Adha</h2>
                    <p>Eid-ul-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the holy month of fasting. On this day, Muslims perform
                        special
                        prayers at mosques and open grounds. Families gather to exchange greetings and gifts, and
                        children
                        receive "Eidi" money from elders. Traditional dishes such as semai, biryani, and kebabs are
                        enjoyed.
                        Eid-ul-Adha, known as the Festival of Sacrifice, commemorates Prophet Ibrahim’s devotion to God.
                        People sacrifice animals such as cows, goats, or camels, and the meat is shared with family,
                        friends, and the poor. Both Eid festivals emphasize generosity, unity, and the importance of
                        community bonds.</p>

                        idol in rivers. Families come together to share festive meals and sweets. People dress in

                        traditional clothes and visit different pandals to enjoy the celebrations. The festival fosters
